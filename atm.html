	<p>Throughout the years of being in ATM I have learned several different programs, here is a list of what I've learned.</p>
	
	
	
	<h2>6th grade learing</h2>
	<ul>
<li>Typing</li><p>Typing is a very important part of this class. Not knowing how to type
 would slow everthing you do down. If you can't type then you can't keep up with the 
 fast pace programs in this class. I'm glad I learned to type because it makes life
easier and it opens up a whole new world to jobs for me.</p>
<li>Microsoft Word</li><p> Microsoft was not necessarily I had to learn but it's good to
		 know how to use it just in case I need to write a paper or something in that nature.</p>
</ul>
	
<h2>7th grade learning</h2>
<ul>
<li>Photoshop</li><p>I enjoyed learning how to use Photoshop because I never thought
I would learn to. It was interesting to see how photos could transform just by using 
Photoshop. I learned how to smooth objects, patch, take items from one pictue and add 
it to another, and much more.</P>
<li>Khan Academy</li><p>Khan Academy is very beneifical to me  because it is the whole reason 
why I am able to make this very website. Coding also gives me more job opportunitiest<p>	
<li>Sketchup</li><p> Sketchup is a 3d program that allows you to build objects. This would be a 
	good use for a construction worker or a job similar to that. </p>
<li>Floor Planner </li><p>This is similar to Sketchup but it allows you to see your creation in 3d and 2d.</p>
		
		</ul>
	<h2>8th grade learn</h2>
	
	<ul>
		
	<li>CSS and HTML</li>
	<p>CSS has made coding more fun becuase it gives websites a unique touch.</p>
	<li>HTML</li>
	<p>These are the basics of coding, this makes us a website.</p>
