	<h2>High School</h2>
	<p>I plan on attending Lakewood high school and attending medical programs
		so i can become an anesthesiologist or something in the medical field.
		Since a good part of my family is involved in the medical field they
		have inspired me to be in the medical field. 
	</p>

	<h2>College</h2>
	<p>I'm not sure what college I want to go to, maybe UCLA? I want to get a Phd 
		just in case I want to be a doctor or something that requires that degree.
